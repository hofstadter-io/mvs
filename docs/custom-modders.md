# Custom Modders

Modders are the struct name for the
internal code which controls how
modules and vendoring is handled.
You can configure as many of these as you like,
by providing global or local `.mvsconfig.yaml` files.

See the following two files for the configuration options

- [./lib/modder/custom/modder.go](./lib/modder/custom/modder.go)
- [./lib/modder/exec/modder.go](./lib/modder/exec/modder.go)
